      Created in 1970, John Horton Conway made this well known game also known
      as 'Life'. The game is automated and based on 4 rules that determine
      the status of all cells inside the grid. A cell can either be 'alive' or
      'dead'. Every turn (tick) rules get applied to all cells that are
      currently alive. Further Information can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">here</a>.
      <h5 class="title is-5">The rules:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies,
        as if by <strong>under population</strong></li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three neighbours lives on
        to the next generation</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies,
        as if by <strong>overpopulation</strong></li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes
        a live cell, as if by <strong>reproduction</strong></li>
      </ol>
