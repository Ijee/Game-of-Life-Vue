# Game of Life - Vue 2

> John Conway's game of life implementation with vuejs, bulma and Fontawesome! This was a fun project to learn more about vue, webpack and all the fun stuff you can find on npm.
> It should be fairly easy to strip the components down to a bare bone application and build bomberman, snake or even a maze with it easily.
> Everything should be decently commented and work but let me know if you find any issues while running the app.

## Some things to consider in the future:

1.  Zoomable/Draggable grid for more simultaneous cells
2.  Make Navigation / Modal to component
3.  Rule90 ruleset implementation
4.  More interesting scenarios
